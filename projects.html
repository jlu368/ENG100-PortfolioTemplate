	<h3 style="font-family:Graduate">This Website</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Aldrich">This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I also implemented my own novel feature to the website by adding &lt;write about it here>.</p>
	
	<h3 style="font-family:Graduate">NGIC Helmet Re-engineering Project</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Aldrich">As a high school senior, I participated with a team of 3 in the Next Generations Innovators Challenge.  Our goal was to redesign the football helmet to help reduce and prevent concussions.  In this project, I did considerable research on the subjet, made CAD models, and performed extensive testing on our ideas.  We competed in a competition with 40-45 teams from around the state of Illinois and placed 4th.</p>
